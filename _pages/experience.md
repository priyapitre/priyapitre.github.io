Academic Experience/Ongoing Projects
======
* [ArguMentor: Augmenting User Experiences with Counter-Perspectives (advised by Dr Kurt Luther)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02795)
  * As part of Advanced Human-Computer Interaction course
  *  Abstract: ArguMentor is a human-AI collaboration system that highlights claims in opinion pieces, identifies counter-arguments for them using a LLM, and generates a context-based summary of based on current events. It further enhances user understanding through additional features like a Q&A bot (that answers user questions pertaining to the text), DebateMe (an agent that users can argue any side of the piece with) and highlighting (where users can highlight a word or passage to get its definition or context). Our evaluation on news op-eds shows that participants can generate more arguments and counter-arguments and display higher critical thinking skills after engaging with the system. Further discussion highlights a more general need for this kind of a system. 
  * Ongoing work: Updated User study with Prolific, to be submitted to a conference in 2025

* MultiAgent Adversarial Learning for Feedback Generation (advised by Dr. Henning Wachsmuth, collaborators: Omkar Joshi, Timon  Ziegenbein)
