Hello, there! I am an **MS student (Thesis Track)** in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu) (VT), co-advised by [Dr. Xuan Wang](https://xuanwang91.github.io/) and [Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/person/naren-ramakrishnan/). I am also a member of the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/) at VT. My primary research lies in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Argumentation in NLP. My Masters thesis focuses on multi-agent debate for reasoning tasks using LLMs. 

Prior to VT, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science (CS) from [College of Engineering, Pune (now COEP Technological University)](https://www.coeptech.ac.in/). I was a Summer Intern at [BLENDER Lab at UIUC](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/) in 2024, where I worked under [Dr Heng Ji](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). I have also collaborated with [Dr Henning Wachsmuth (Leibniz University Hannover)](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/en/institute/staff/henning-wachsmuth) and [Dr Kurt Luther (Virginia Tech)](https://crowd.cs.vt.edu/kurt-luther/) during my MS. 

In my personal time, I like to run (I ran a half-marathon in 2023, and am working on getting in shape for a full marathon in 2025!) and play board games. I regularly attend Board Game Conventions as much as possible and love games like Blood on the Clocktower, Wingspan, Betrayal, Catan..(this could be an infinite list!). I was an [International British Parliamentary debater](/files/debate_resume.pdf) from 2019-2023, and a Lincoln Douglas Debater from 2015-2018, with multiple wins and breaks as a debater and adjudicator Participating in debates played a pivotal role in sparking my initial interest in argumentation within NLP. 

I am always excited to discuss anything, please reach out to me at priyapitre@vt.edu or on my Twitter/Linkedin!
