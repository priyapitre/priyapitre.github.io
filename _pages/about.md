Hello, there! I am an MS student (Thesis Track) in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech (VT), co-advised by Dr. Xuan Wang and Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan. I am also a member of the Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics at VT. My primary research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Human-Computer Interaction and Argumentation in NLP. My Masters thesis focuses on multi-agent debate for reasoning tasks using LLMs. 

Prior to VT, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science (CS) from College of Engineering, Pune (now COEP Technological University). I was a Summer Intern at BLENDER Lab at UIUC in 2024. I have also collaborated with Dr Henning Wachsmuth (Leibniz University Hannover) and Dr Kurt Luther (Virginia Tech) during my MS. 

In my personal time, I like to run (I ran a half-marathon in 2023, and am looking forward to getting in shape for a full marathon in 2025!) and play board games. I regularly attend Board Game Conventions as much as possible and love games like Blood on the Clocktower, Wingspan, Betrayal, Catan..(this is an infinite list!)

I am always excited to discuss anything, please reach out to me at priyapitre@vt.edu or on my Twitter/Linkedin!
